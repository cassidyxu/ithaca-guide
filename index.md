# Activities in Ithaca Initiative 🌿

Welcome to the **Activities in Ithaca Guide**, created by Cornell students to help first-year students discover fun, affordable, and accessible things to do both on campus and around the Ithaca area.

Our goal is to make it easier for new students to explore, connect, and make the most of their time at Cornell — all in one centralized place.

## 🎯 About This Project

Every year, thousands of new Cornell students arrive in Ithaca, often without knowing what’s happening beyond campus.  
While Cornell’s newsletters list some on-campus events, many students miss out on the broader range of local experiences — from hiking trails and cafés to seasonal festivals and markets.

The **Activities in Ithaca Initiative** consolidates scattered information from multiple sources (Visit Ithaca, Cornell event pages, student blogs, and more) into one interactive, filterable guide.

## 👥 Who This Is For

**First-year Cornell students** — or anyone new to the Ithaca community — who want:
- Reliable, up-to-date information on activities and events
