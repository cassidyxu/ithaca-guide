      <h1>About This Guide</h1>
      <p>
        This site was built as a Cornell student project to help students find
        realistic, low-stress ways to explore Ithaca. It focuses on off-campus
        options, TCAT-friendly routes, and things you can actually do between
        classes or on weekends.
      </p>

      <h2>How to Use It</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Start with <strong>Closest to Campus</strong> if you&apos;re short on
          time.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use <strong>Cheap Thrills</strong> when money is tight.
        </li>
        <li>
          Filter by weather using <strong>Rain-Proof Plans</strong> and{" "}
          <strong>Fall Favorites</strong>.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Accessibility & Constraints</h2>
      <p>
        We try to flag distance, transit options, and rough price so you can
        quickly see if an activity works with your time, mobility, and budget.
